<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

# checkRtrack

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

R package to define track widths. It is created for the course "Introduction to Programming with R". 
For now, you can define the lowest points along your track to then define the outer limits of the tracks. 


## Installation

You can install checkRtrack with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("geoniesun/checkRtrack")
```

## Exemplary Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(checkRtrack)
## basic example code
```

## Roadmap
- [ ]  Visualize the crossprofiles from the side. To see if there is actually a path
- [ ]  Set more filter that determine a path
- [ ]  Create more options to modify the users definition of the "path end" (for now its the steepest slope point)



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
